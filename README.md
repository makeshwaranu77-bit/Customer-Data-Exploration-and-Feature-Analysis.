📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:

Customer identifiers

Demographic or financial features

Spending or transaction-related variables

The dataset is explored for missing values, distributions, and relationships between features.

🔍 Workflow

Data Loading – Import dataset using Pandas

Initial Inspection – Shape, data types, null values

Data Cleaning – Handle missing or inconsistent values

Univariate Analysis – Feature-wise distribution analysis

Multivariate Analysis – Feature relationships and correlations

Visualization – Graphical insights using plots

Interpretation – Business-relevant observations

📈 Output & Insights

Clear understanding of customer feature distributions

Identification of influential features

Detection of correlations and trends

Actionable insights for segmentation and prediction tasks

Example insights:

Features strongly correlated with customer spending

High-variance features suitable for segmentation

Potential outliers affecting analysis
